# RDFC: _Rate-distortion with fixed cardinality_

This repository contains an implementation of Algorithm 1 in [Banerjee et al. (2004)](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/public_papers/icml04breg.pdf) that can produce solutions to the RDFC problem by combining the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm and the mapping approach by Rose: [RD_FC.py](https://github.com/sgttwld/rate-distortion-with-fixed-cardinality/blob/master/RD_FC.py).

### View the [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sgttwld/rate-distortion-with-fixed-cardinality/blob/master/RDFC_nb.ipynb) (using nbviewer) for a comparison with standard rate-distortion algorithms.
